      <h1 class="essay"><strong>In their New York, restaurants are yet to be tasted and concert tickets are to be bought. New “utterly fantastic” museum exhibits will shape them into uniquely cultured, intellectual individuals. Weekends are filled with day trips antiquing along Hudson River towns and evenings exploring the city’s vibrant nightlife. To these people, the Big Apple is The City That Never Sleeps, a city unlike any other and one that, if you can survive there, you can make it anywhere. To them, all of New York City is their Manhattan bubble of a life. They function in their little circle which spans from the Lower East Side to the Upper West (and no further!) and converse with their Manhattan friends all working at the same type of corporate job. To them, New York City is about chasing dreams and living an exciting, ever-changing lifestyle. In light of the media’s skewed portrayal of New York - an equilibrium between glamor, liveliness, and grunge - and infatuated by the spell that the collective city has sweet talked the world into being victim of, many’s view of New York City has a blind spot.</strong></h1>
      <h1 class="essay"><strong>Across the East River, on the corner of my block is a Cherry Blossom tree. Every day since sixth grade, I’ve passed that tree religiously twice a day; when the leaves turn amber, I stroll underneath them. I peek into the house across the street. I still see the green scaffolding which dominated that corner for so many years, hear the whistling of construction workers. In the facade I recognize the house it was prior to the grand makeover and am taken back a century further picturing that same foundation so deeply rooted in the Cobble Hill ground.</strong></h1>
      <h1 class="essay"><strong>Passing by my elementary school, waving at previous teachers of mine, I am greeted by the remembrance of school hall laughter. The crossing guard ushers me along and wishes me a wonderful day. “Good morning” I chirp to her, just as I have every morning for the past five years. I continue to stroll along the canopied way and onto Court Street where I see the wagging tails of dogs in the doggie daycare at the start of each day and the silent, dim room at the end. On this return, I can safely rely on the consistency of these landmarks. When I’ve finally made it close to home, I stomp on the fallen leaves of the Cherry Blossom tree just to hear them crunch.</strong></h1>
      <h1 class="essay"><strong>As if it’s clockwork, I pass the same markers each day without fail. My New York is a constant, a comfort. It’s reliable for average people living simple lives. Rarely is my walk disrupted by an out of the ordinary event, which even then is most likely the sighting of a rat or someone from my past. This is not to say that the charismatic New York the city presents itself as is fabricated, rather that it is a superficial perspective of the city that only presents itself to people who deliberately seek it out. At the end of the day, New York is no different from any other place: it is a home filled with people living routinized, mundane lives.</strong></h1>
      <h1 class="essay"><strong>I repeat the process down to the minute. At 7:46 I’ll be at the end of my block, admiring the budding branches and their peeking green. By 7:52, I’ll be Court Street bound, having already passed my elementary school, teachers, and the crossing guard. And at 7:55 I will be right dab in front of Monster Mutt Doggie Daycare, ready for my final sprint to the train.</strong></h1>
      <h1 class="essay"><strong>Each morning, I’ll wake up as a New Yorker. I’ll complete my same routine, strolling underneath the rosy pink flowers, passing my neighborhood landmarks, waving to my fellow Brooklynites, and live my ordinary New York Life.</strong></h1>
